How to run a RAD-68 test manually using xtools. 
Assumes an installed standard setup.

1. Make sure xtools are started. If not, run:

/opt/xdsi/bin/start.sh

2. generate the kos and metadata you want to test. For example, running

/opt/xdsi/test/ids/ids-single-image-01.pl DCM4CHEE-111

would create a directory

/opt/xdsi/storage/runtime/patientId/kos (where patientId is the newly assigned id)
containing the files

kos.dcm and metadata.xml

Copy these files to:

/opt/xdsi/tomcat/apache-tomcat-7.0.65-xdstools2-01/webapps/xdstools2/toolkitx/testkit/testdata-repository/RAD-68

Note: The files in this directory need to have the above names, so if yours
are different, change them.

3. surf to xtools: http://localhost:9280/xdstools2/

   Select XDS Provide and Register in the Submit section on the left side

   Select Test Data Set RAD-68
   Send to: Check xdsi01__rep-reg
   Patient ID enter your patient id, for example:

      DEPT201512171036005^^^&1.2.3&ISO
   
   Click the Run Button. You should see black stuff.

Note: You MUST surf to xdstools AFTER you have copied the files for the
web app to find them.

The results will be in a sub directory of:

/opt/xdsi/xds-toolkit/01/simdb/xdsi01__rep-reg/rep/prb

The sub directory will be named based on the time of the transaction, for
example: 2015_12_18_11_08_47_414
